🧠 NLP Learning Journey: 15 Weeks from Fundamentals to LLMs

Welcome to my NLP learning project. Over the next 15 weeks, I’m diving deep into Natural Language Processing — learning from the ground up, building weekly projects, and sharing everything in this repo and a companion blog series.

👋 About Me

My name is Ryan McNamara. I’m a Senior Data Scientist working in healthcare, with a background in engineering and applied math. Over the past year, I’ve worked on machine learning projects including ER prediction, graph neural networks, and medical claims summarization.

I recently completed a data science master’s at Columbia University, where I was introduced to NLP through coursework. That exposure sparked my interest — but I knew I had only scratched the surface. Now, I’m committing to going deeper.

📚 What This Project Is

This repo will contain:

	•	Weekly mini-projects and notebooks that build up from classical NLP to LLMs.
	•	All code, learning materials, and implementation notes.
	•	A companion blog series on Medium documenting my weekly progress, reflections, and key takeaways.

🧭 Learning Roadmap

Each week focuses on a core NLP concept or model, building toward real-world LLM workflows:

🧠 Phase 1: Classical NLP (Weeks 1–4)

	•	Tokenization
	•	TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words
	•	POS tagging & NER
	•	Word2Vec & GloVe

🔬 Phase 2: Neural NLP (Weeks 5-8)

	•	RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs
	•	Attention Mechanism and Transformers
	•	BERT & GPT-style models

🪨 Phase 3: LLMs & Advanced Topics (Weeks 9-12)

	•	LLMs
	•	Prompt engineering
	•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

🚀 Phase 4: Capstone Project (Weeks 13-15)

	•	Build, train, and deploy a full NLP pipeline
	•	Model serving, inference, and monitoring

⸻

🎯 Project Goals

	1.	Document my learning journey to solidify my understanding of NLP, from foundational theory to applied projects.
	2.	Provide a roadmap and resources for other data scientists or engineers entering the NLP and LLM space.

📌 Follow Along

	•	💻 Code: All code will be pushed regularly to this GitHub repo
	•	📝 Blog: I’ll share reflections and learnings on Medium (link coming soon)
	•	🕒 Timeline: While the plan is 15 weeks, I may adjust the pace to fit life and work. The goal is consistency, not perfection.


I’m excited to get into the weeds of NLP and uncover what’s under the hood of the LLM sportscar. However long it takes, this journey is happening.
