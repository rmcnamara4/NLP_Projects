🧠 NLP Learning Journey: 15 Weeks from Fundamentals to LLMs

Welcome to my NLP learning project. Over the next 15 weeks, I’m diving deep into Natural Language Processing — learning from the ground up, building weekly projects, and sharing everything in this repo and a companion blog series.

👋 About Me

My name is Ryan McNamara. I’m a Senior Data Scientist working in healthcare, with a background in engineering and applied math. Over the past year, I’ve worked on machine learning projects including ER prediction, graph neural networks, and medical claims summarization.

I recently completed a data science master’s at Columbia University, where I was introduced to NLP through coursework. That exposure sparked my interest — but I knew I had only scratched the surface. Now, I’m committing to going deeper.

📚 What This Project Is

This repo will contain:
	•	Weekly mini-projects and notebooks that build up from classical NLP to LLMs.
	•	All code, learning materials, and implementation notes.
	•	A companion blog series on Medium documenting my weekly progress, reflections, and key takeaways.

🧭 Learning Roadmap

Each week focuses on a core NLP concept or model, building toward real-world LLM workflows:

🧠 Phase 1: Classical NLP (Weeks 1–5)
	•	Tokenization
	•	TF-IDF / Bag-of-Words
	•	POS tagging & NER
	•	Word2Vec & GloVe

🔬 Phase 2: Neural NLP (Weeks 6–10)
	•	RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs
	•	Attention Mechanism
	•	Transformer from Scratch

🪨 Phase 3: LLMs & Advanced Topics (Weeks 11–13)
	•	BERT & GPT-style models
	•	Prompt engineering
	•	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

🚀 Phase 4: Capstone Project (Weeks 14–15)
	•	Build, train, and deploy a full NLP pipeline
	•	Model serving, inference, and monitoring

⸻

🎯 Project Goals

	1.	Document my learning journey to solidify my understanding of NLP, from foundational theory to applied projects.
	2.	Provide a roadmap and resources for other data scientists or engineers entering the NLP and LLM space.

📌 Follow Along
	•	💻 Code: All code will be pushed regularly to this GitHub repo
	•	📝 Blog: I’ll share reflections and learnings on Medium (link coming soon)
	•	🕒 Timeline: While the plan is 15 weeks, I may adjust the pace to fit life and work. The goal is consistency, not perfection.

> I’m excited to get into the weeds of NLP and uncover what’s under the hood of the LLM sportscar. However long it takes, this journey is happening.
