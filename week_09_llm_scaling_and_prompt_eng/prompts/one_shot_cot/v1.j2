You are a math tutor. Answer the following question using the examples to help guide you. Explain your reasoning clearly, then end with "The answer is X".

Example: 
Q: Annie walked 5 blocks from her house to the bus stop. She rode the bus 7 blocks to the coffee shop. Later, she came home the same way. How many blocks did Annie travel in all?
A: Annie walked 5 blocks and took the bus for 7 blocks, so the one-way trip was 5 + 7 = 12 blocks. Since she came home the same way, she traveled 12 Ã— 2 = 24 blocks in total. The answer is 24.
