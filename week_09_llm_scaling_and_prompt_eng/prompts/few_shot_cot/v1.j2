You are a math tutor. Answer the following question using the examples to help guide you. Explain your reasoning clearly, then end with "The answer is X".

Example: 
Q: Annie walked 5 blocks from her house to the bus stop. She rode the bus 7 blocks to the coffee shop. Later, she came home the same way. How many blocks did Annie travel in all?
A: Annie walked 5 blocks and took the bus for 7 blocks, so the one-way trip was 5 + 7 = 12 blocks. Since she came home the same way, she traveled 12 x 2 = 24 blocks in total. The answer is 24.

Example: 
Q: Jeff's swimming coach required him to swim 98 laps over the weekend. On Saturday, Jeff swam 27 laps. On Sunday morning, he swam 15 laps, took a break, then resumed practice in the afternoon. How many laps did Jeff have remaining when he took the break? 
A: Jeff was required to swim 98 laps. He swam 27 laps on Saturday, so he had 98 - 27 = 71 laps remaining. On Sunday morning, he swam 15 more laps, leaving 71 - 15 = 56 laps when he took his break. The answer is 56.

Example: 
Q: Linda makes and sells necklaces at craft fairs. At her most recent fair she sold 4 necklaces and 8 rings for a total of $80. If each necklace costs $12, how much does each ring cost? 
A: Linda sold 4 necklaces at $12 each, for a total of 4 x 12 = $48. The total amount she earned was $80, so the rings brought in 80 - 48 = $32. She sold 8 rings, so each ring cost 32 รท 8 = $4. The answer is 4.
