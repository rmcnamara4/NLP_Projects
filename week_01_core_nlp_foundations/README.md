# Week 1 – Core NLP Foundations

## Overview
This week focused on fundamental NLP concepts through two applied projects:  
1. **N-Gram Language Model** – Implemented unigram, bigram, and trigram models with smoothing and perplexity evaluation.  
2. **Sentiment Classification** – Built a binary classifier using TF-IDF features and traditional ML models.
