# Week 2 â€“ Classical NLP Techniques

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This week focused on classical NLP models through two applied projects:  
1. **Named Entity Recognition** â€“ Implemented a CRF model and applied a SpaCy pre-trained model for NER
2. **Part-of-Speech Tagging** â€“ Built a Hidden Markov Model for predicting POS

## ðŸ“‚ Projects
- [NER/](./ner)  
- [POS Tagging/](./pos_tagging)  

## ðŸ§  Key Skills
- Sequence labeling with CRF and HMM  
- Feature engineering for token-level classification  
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) and label mapping across datasets  
- Part-of-Speech tagging using probabilistic models  
- Model evaluation with precision, recall, and F1-score  
- Working with the CoNLL-2003 dataset  
- Comparing classical statistical models to modern transformer-based approaches
