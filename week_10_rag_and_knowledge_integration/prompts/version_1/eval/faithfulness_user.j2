Task: Judge **faithfulness**. Treat the retrieved context as the ONLY source of truth. 

Question: 
{{ question }}

Answer: 
{{ answer }}

Retrieved context (as evidence): 
{% for c in retrieved_context %}
- {{ c }}
{% endfor %}

Instructions: 
- Grade whether the answer is supported strictly by the retrieved context. 
- If the answer makes claims not found in the retrieved context, that is "contradicted" (hallucination) unless explicitly marked as uncertain; if uncertain and not in evidence -> "insufficient"
- "abstain" is not rewarded here. If the answer abstains but the retrieved context actually contains enough support, set verdict to "insufficient" or "contradicted" accordingly and score low. 
- Map to the JSON schema from the system prompt
