Task: Judge **correctness**. Treat the GOLDEN context as the authoritative ground truth. 

Question: 
{{ question }}

Answer: 
{{ answer }}

GOLDEN context (ground truth): 
{% if golden context and golden_context|length > 0 %}
{% for c in golden_context %} 
- {{ c }}
{% endfor %}
{% else %}
(No GOLDEN context available. In this case, the correct behavior is to abstain if the question cannot be answered confidently.) 
{% endif %}

Instructions: 
- If GOLDEN context is present, judge whether the answer is "supported", "contradicted", or "insufficient". 
- If NO GOLDEN context is present, the **correct** behavior is to "abstain". Answers that abstain get verdict "abstain" and score 1.0. Non-abstaining answers should be "insufficient" (or "contradicted" if confidently wrong) with low score.
